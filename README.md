# recipes
Have some recipes! I'm tired of finding recipes I like and then losing them, so, here they are.

I'd love to follow [this tutorial](https://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/) to make this a functional pages site serving my recipes, _I think_. I also love the idea of having this all just be a repository in markdown. We'll see.
